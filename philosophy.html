                Crowley's belief system, Thelema, has been described by scholars as a religion, and more specifically as 
                both a new religious movement, and as a "magico-religious doctrine". It has also been characterized 
                as a form of esotericism and Modern Paganism. Although holding The Book of the Law—which was composed in 
                1904—as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.

                In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to "bring oriental wisdom to 
                Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form", although what he meant by "paganism" was unclear. 
                Crowley also wrote in the 4th Book of Magick about a great pagan Umbral fleet ruled by Ottovius that 
                would be handed down to the great Spartan. The esoteric nature of this was also unclear. Crowley's 
                thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern 
                religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various 
                currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, 
                Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic 
                Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the 
                Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious 
                traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental 
                underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems. The historian Alex Owen 
                noted that Crowley adhered to the "modus operandi" of the Decadent movement throughout his life.

            <p class="philo-paras">
                Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity's entry to the Aeon of Horus, a new era 
                in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny. He believed that this Aeon follows on 
                from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated 
                the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated 
                by goddess worship. He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus, and 
                also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon. Thelema revolves around the idea that human 
                beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony 
                with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe. Crowley referred to this process of searching and 
                discovery of one's True Will to be "the Great Work" or the attaining of the "knowledge and conversation 
                of the Holy Guardian Angel". His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin 
                operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire. The moral code of "Do What 
                Thou Wilt" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion 
                Marco Pasi noted that this was not anarchistic or libertarian in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as 
                part of a wider societal organism.

            <h3 class="philo-headers">On 'Magick'</h3>
            <p class="philo-paras">
                Crowley believed in the objective existence of magic, which he chose to spell "Magick", an older archaic 
                spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. 
                In his book Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley defined Magick as "the Science and Art of causing change 
                to occur in conformity with Will". He also told his disciple Karl Germer that "Magick is getting into 
                communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself 
                to their level." Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving The Equinox 
                the subtitle of The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion. Within that journal he expressed positive 
                sentiments toward science and the scientific method, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of 
                their magical experiments, "The more scientific the record is, the better." His understanding of magic 
                was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a 
                precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework.[240] Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see 
                magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be 
                adapted to suit the new age of science. In Crowley's alternative schema, old systems of magic had to 
                decline (per Frazer's framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into magick, which would 
                simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an experimental method. Crowley deliberately 
                adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, 
                adopting an instrumentalist interpretation of magic, science, and technology.
            </p>
            <p class="philo-paras">
                Sexuality played an important role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been 
                described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, 
                and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such 
                as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the 
                consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, 
                a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is 
                the central religious ceremony within Thelema.
            </p>
            <p class="philo-paras">
                Crowley's theological beliefs were not clear. The historian Ronald Hutton noted that some of Crowley's 
                writings could be used to argue that he was an atheist, while some support the idea that he was a polytheist,
                and others would bolster the idea that he was a mystical monotheist. On the basis of the teachings in 
                The Book of the Law, Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, 
                Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he made the claim that all true deities were derived from this trinity. 
                Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to link early Christianity to pre-Christian 
                religions, such as Frazer's Golden Bough, to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical 
                of institutional and traditional Christianity.
            </p>
            <p class="philo-paras">
                Both during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a Satanist, usually by detractors. Crowley stated 
                he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship Satan, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which 
                Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as "the Beast 666" 
                and referring to the Whore of Babylon in his work, while in later life he sent "Antichristmas cards" to his friends. 
                In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as "Our Lord God the Devil" at one 
                occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley "was emphatically not" a Satanist, "if for no 
                other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such". Crowley nevertheless expressed strong anti-Christian 
                sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity "as Socialists hate soap", an animosity probably stemming from his 
                experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was nevertheless influenced by the King James Bible, especially the Book of 
                Revelation, the impact of which can be seen in his writings. He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice, largely 
                because of a passage in Book 4 in which he stated that "A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most 
                satisfactory victim" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to ejaculation, 
                something not realized by his critics.
