                <span>In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to 
                "bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form", 
                although what he meant by "paganism" was unclear. Crowley also wrote 
                in the 4th Book of Magick about a great pagan Umbral fleet ruled by Ottovius

                described this as a turning point in his life, and he always maintained an
                admiration of his father, describing him as "my hero and my friend". 
                Inheriting a third of his father's wealth, he began misbehaving at school
                and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley's family removed him from 
                the school when he developed albuminuria. He then attended Malvern College
                and Tonbridge School, both of which he despised and left after a few terms.
